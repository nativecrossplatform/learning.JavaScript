/*

Basic Operators:

-> Assignment Operator (=)
Used to Assign a value to something.

-> Arithmetic operators ( + , - , * , / , %):
+ -> Addition
( when used to combine a string and a string, the addition operator acts as a concatenation operator and joins the two strings
if used on a number and a string then it will treat the number as a string and then add it for eg: 12 + "hello" will give 12hello as output)
- -> Subtraction
* -> Multiplication
/ -> Division
% -> Modulus
+= Addition Assignment

-> Comparison Operators:
(used to compare between two entities)
>= Greater than equal to
<= Less than equal to
>  Greater than
<  Less than
!= Not equal to 
== Equal to
=== Strictly equal to
(The strict equality operator compares for both the values and the data types. With the strict equality operator, comparing 5 === 5 still returns true. The values on each side of the strict equality operator have the same value and the same type. However, comparing 5 == "5" now returns false, because the values are equal, but the data type is different.)
!== Strictly not equal to
(For the strict inequality operator to return false, the compared values have to have the same value and the same data type. 
For example,  5 !== 5 returns false because it is false to say that the number 5 is not of the same value and data type and another number 5.)

-> Logical Operators:
&& AND
|| OR
!  NOT
